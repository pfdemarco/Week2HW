							<p class="about">
								I am an Engineer for Qorvo, with expertise in test engineering and data compilation. 
								We use Spotfire to showcase data and characterize our components for internal and external customer use. 
								This information helps us optimize our components for maximum RF power output and minimal DC power usage over normal and severe environmental conditions.
								I enjoy writing test programs that automate what a user would do to test a part and the collection of data.
							</p>
							<p class="about">
								In previous roles I was a technical sales engineer for a telcom company. My responsibilities included getting products released and approved in labs of the major carriers and neutral hosts.
								I was responsible for making sure products could send SNMP traps to a NOC and alert the NOC of possible issues with the network.
								I was in charge of local and remote training sessions of the products that we were deploying on their network and new products that we were coming out with to optimize their network.
								I would create iBwave designs for public safety installations. Helping the customer come up with financially responsible designs to meet their needs and the requirements of the local AHJ (authorities having jurisdiction).
							</p>
							<p class="about">
								I also have experience in the defense industry as a test engineer writing applications that would automate testing and data collection.
								This included being a ISSO Information Systems Security Officer responsible for keeping secret data and equipment sanitized for proper use.
								Most of the applications I wrote were in Labview or Visual Basic.
